abstract: Digital twinning systems are effective tools to test and develop new robotic
  capabilities before applying them in the real world. This work presents a real-time
  digital double framework that improves and facilitates robot perception of the environment.
  Soft or non-rigid terrains can cause locomotion failures, while visual perception
  alone is often insufficient to assess the physical properties of such surfaces.
  To tackle this problem we employ the proposed framework to estimate ground collapsibility
  through physical interactions while the robot is dynamically walking on challenging
  terrains. We extract discrepancy information between the two systems, a simulated
  digital double that is synchronized with a real robot, both using exactly the same
  physical model and locomotion controller. The discrepancy in sensor measurements
  between the real robot and its digital double serves as a critical indicator of
  anomalies between expected and actual motion and is utilized as input to a learning-based
  model for terrain collapsibility analysis. The performance of the collapsibility
  estimation was evaluated in a variety of real-world scenarios involving flat, inclined,
  elevated, and outdoor terrains. Our results demonstrate the generality and efficacy
  of our real-time digital double architecture for estimating terrain collapsibility.
